<h3>How to use this plugin</h3>
<p>
    By default, the comments plugin tab displays for example: "Comments (2/5)". This means that two comments are
    waiting for approval in the moderation list out of five total comments.
</p>
<p>
  On each page edit screen, you will have a drop-down box available called "Comments".
  From this, you can choose between three options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>none: if you do not want comments displayed on the page.</li>
  <li>open: if you want comments displayed and want people to be able to post comments.</li>
  <li>close: if you want to display comments, but do not want people do be able to post new comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  You will need to add this code to your layout:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
    if (Plugin::isEnabled('comment'))
    {
        if ($this->comment_status != Comment::NONE)
            $this->includeSnippet('comment-each');
        if ($this->comment_status == Comment::OPEN)
            $this->includeSnippet('comment-form');
    }
?&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
  When you disable the comments plugin, the database table, snippets and page.comment_status stay available.
</p>
<p>
  If you disable the comments plugin, you can leave the code you added to the layout if you want. Use of the isEnabled() function prevents any PHP errors.
</p>
