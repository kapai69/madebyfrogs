Use the readme.txt file to explain to plugin users how to install the plugin!

The skeleton plugin serves as a basic plugin template.

This skeleton plugin makes use/provides the following features:
- A controller without a tab
- Three views (sidebar, documentation and settings)
- A documentation page
- A sidebar
- A settings page (that does nothing except display some text)
- Code that gets run when the plugin is enabled (enable.php)

Note: to use the settings and documentation pages, you will first need to enable
the plugin!

Note 2: in index.php, change the value of require_frog_version into a non-existant Frog
        version and look at the plugins list (in the administration section) again.
