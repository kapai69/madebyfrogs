# FROG CMS - INFORMATION ABOUT UPDATING

## About

Frog CMS began as migration of Radiant CMS from Ruby-on-Rails to PHP.
This product has been made available under the terms of the GNU AGPL version 3.
Please read the license.txt for the exact details;

The official Frog website can be found at www.madebyfrog.com - visit for further
information and resources.

Please be aware that we only support single version upgrades. That means you upgrade
from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4 and only then to 0.9.5.

## UPDATING FROM 0.9.4 to 0.9.5  -- TO BE CHECKED AND UPDATED --

WARNING - The split between frontend and backend in the Frog code has been removed in this
          version. This has led to significant code changes. You will need to update ALL files.

Please remember to MAKE BACKUPS before trying to update!

The best and most comprehensive method of upgrading to Frog 0.9.5 is to install Frog from scratch,
including the database.

NOTES:

- The public directory now contains a themes subdirectory.
  It is advised that all themes for Frog follow the same approach as the Normal theme.
- It is advised to always use the htaccess file. You can dis/enable the url rewriting by setting RewriteEngine to On/Off.
