# FROG CMS - INFORMATION ABOUT UPDATING

## About

Frog CMS began as migration of Radiant CMS from Ruby-on-Rails to PHP.
This product has been made available under the terms of the GNU AGPL version 3.
Please read the license.txt for the exact details;

The official Frog website can be found at www.madebyfrog.com - visit for further
information and resources.

Please be aware that we only support single version upgrades. That means you upgrade
from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4 and only then to 0.9.5.

## UPDATING FROM 0.9.4 to 0.9.5  -- TO BE CHECKED AND UPDATED --

WARNING - The split between frontend and backend in the Frog code has been removed in this
          version. This has led to significant code changes. You will need to update ALL files.

Please remember to MAKE BACKUPS before trying to update!

Updating consists of a few seperate steps. When executed correctly, this method of upgrading will keep
downtime to a minimum. Please READ CAREFULLY:

1. Make a backup of your current Frog installation.

2. Make a backup of your current Frog database.

3. Create a temporary directory. We'll use this to prepare the upgrade in.

4. Unzip the Frog package into the temporary directory as if you would install into it.

5. Remove the "public" directory and everything in it from the temporary directory.

6. Remove the config.php and _.htaccess files from the temporary directory.

7. Copy all the non-core plugin directories from ../frog/plugins to your temporary location's ../frog/plugins directory.

--- CHECK step 8 ---

8. Execute the following two SQL statements on your database:
    INSERT INTO setting (name, value) VALUES ('default_tab', '');
    INSERT INTO setting (name, value) VALUES ('allow_html_title', 'off');

9. Copy all the files from the temporary directory to your installation's root, replacing the old files.

10. Check your site to see if the upgrade didn't break anything.

You're done!
