# FROG CMS - INFORMATION ABOUT UPDATING

## General

Please be aware that we only support single version upgrades. That means you
upgrade from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4 and only then to 0.9.5.

## UPDATING FROM 0.9.4 to 0.9.5  -- TO BE CHECKED AND UPDATED --

WARNING - The split between frontend and backend in the Frog code has been
          removed in this version. This has led to significant code changes.

          You will need to update *ALL* files.

Please remember to MAKE BACKUPS of Frog and your DB before trying to update!

The best and most comprehensive method of upgrading to Frog 0.9.5 is
unfortunately to install Frog from scratch, including the database.

You can then import pages, comments, etc. manually from the DB backup you made.

Due to the large number of significant changes, this is the only recommended
method of upgrading to 0.9.5.

To prevent this from happening in next versions, an export/import function will
be made available in post-0.9.5. releases.

## NOTES

- The public directory now contains a themes subdirectory.
  It is advised that all themes for Frog follow the same approach as the
  Normal theme.
- It is advised to always use the htaccess file. You can dis/enable the url
  rewriting by setting RewriteEngine to On/Off.
