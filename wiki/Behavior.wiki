= What are a behavior in Frog CMS =

  * A behavior is what you can apply to a page to make it different! 
  * A behavior take control of all is children page
  * A behavior can redefine all page method by "overwriting* the Page class

== HOWTO create a new behavior ==

this a a work in progress documentation for the implementation of the behavior in the next and first version *1*

first is to create a folder in the frog/behaviors folder. (the name of the folder have to be underscored ie: *my_archive_version*

then you have to create a file with the name of the class and this one have to be camelized ie: *MyArchiveVersion.php*

the content of this file have to start with this model:

{{{
<?php

class MyArchiveVersion
{
    function __construct(&$page, $params)
    {
        $this->page =& $page;
        $this->params = $params;
    }
}

?>
}}}


then you can, but it is optional, extends the page class by creating a file with the same name as the behavior but with Page before it ie: PageMyArchiveVersion.php

and this one have to look like:

{{{
<?php

class PageMyArchiveVersion extends Page
{
    // ...
}
}}} 

then overwrite method (function) that you need to be different.

or this is the basic ... of what you need to know ... and don't forget when you apply a behavior (page type) to a page, all is children are now depending of it, Frog give the control to the behavior, so watch out!!  ;)

a other thing to know that is important is that the page is passed by reference, so if you redefine it, be sure that it is a instance of a Page and have a _executeLayout() function and _saveComment() function this are the two function that will be called automatically by Frog CMS
