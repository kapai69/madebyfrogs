#summary A roadmap for future Frog releases. NOT FINISHED
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

This document contains the roadmap for the Frog project. It is important to know that the roadmap is not set in stone. This means that we will probably follow the roadmap very accurately, it may also mean that we decide to do something else due to changing priorities for example.

Hi all,

Since it is always useful to figure out where you're going, I thought it would be nice to decide on a roadmap for Frog together.

To kick off the discussion concerning the roadmap, I've created a first proposal. You can add/change/delete items from the roadmap by replying to this post or by editing the wiki topic I created for it: http://code.google.com/p/madebyfrogs/wiki/RoadMap

Now, here's my first draft... (if you're wondering about the names... they're my suggestions for code names, not necessary but nice ;-) )

+ Added admin section option to choose default tab after login (issue 29)
